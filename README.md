Hi I'm a kid interested in programming. I've been doing an internship for the past couple of months and I recently started learning x86-64 assembly, though I might have to start studying for my exams soon. ;-;

Other interests include: 
  - Languages (good in German, trying in French and Serbian, FYI Bulgarian is my mother tongue)
  - Music (Guitar and a little bit of drums)
  - Fitness (DL, squat, bench, calisthenics)
  - Chess (basically wasting my time on chess.com)
  - Poetry
